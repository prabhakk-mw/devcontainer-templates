# MATLAB Template for Development Containers

The templates hosted in this repository enable VSCode and GitHub Codespaces to provision Development Container with all the necessary dependencies to build MATLAB&reg; based applications.

## MATLAB Templates

A variety of tools and services [support](https://containers.dev/supporting) the Dev Container Spec, and they may provide direct integrations with the Templates in this repo. For instance, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) provide a user-friendly interface to configure the Templates hosted in this repository. Additionally, you can customize your dev container with additional available [MATLAB Features](https://github.com/mathworks/devcontainer-features).

For more information, please refer to the following documents for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/create-dev-container#_automate-dev-container-creation) and [Github Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/introduction-to-dev-containers#using-a-predefined-dev-container-configuration).

### MATLAB

Starts a dev container with an Docker image based on the official MathWorks&reg; Docker images available on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mathworks).

For more information, see this [README](./src/matlab/README.md)

### MATLAB Integration with Jupyter

Starts a dev container with an Docker image based on the [MATLAB Integration for Jupyter](https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/matlab-integration-for-jupyter/tree/main/matlab) Docker images published onto the GitHub Container Registry.

For more information, see this [README](./src/matlab-integration-for-jupyter/README.md)

## Usage

### From VSCode

< Insert Images that showcase the workflows >

### From GitHub

< Here users will have to start a codespace using the template repository and develop within it to create their own Application? >
